<p>Our main aim is to explore and understand the population adaption and speciation by various methods, such as genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metagenomics. For this, we mainly focus on two study systems.</p>

<p>Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:</p>

<p><strong>Scanning tunneling noise spectroscopy (STNS).</strong> We have developed a novel cryogenic MHz amplifier that allows us to measure not only the average tunneling current, but also its fluctuation! This has many applications: one can detect the fluctuations of the electronic states, peculiar tunneling processes, and shot noise. We have used this instrument to discover charge trapping in the insulating layer of the cuprates, connected to the c-axis mystery, and to measure the doubling of the charge due to Andreev processes to the superfluid in a lead sample.</p>

<p><strong>地下啮齿动物的适应性进化</strong></p>

<p>地下鼠是一类终生地下生活的植食性小哺乳动物的总称，全世界地下鼠共有250多种，广泛分布于亚洲、非洲、美洲、欧洲大陆，多生活于开放地带如热带草原、草原、山地、干旱及半干旱地区，也有一些生活在茂密的灌丛和森林。</p>

<p>在长期的进化过程中，地下鼠形成了特殊的适应性进化特征，这对于研究生物钟调节与长寿现象、低氧适应与抗癌特性等具有重要的学术意义和应用价值，是值得关注的研究方向。有关地下鼠的相关资料自古就有记载，《尔雅·释兽》称鼢鼠、鼹鼠“地中行者”，又有《本草拾遗》载：“隐鼠，阴穿地中行，见日月光则死，于深山林木下土中有之，主大瘘疮。”</p>

<p>我们拟从以下几个方面研究地下啮齿动物适应性进化的分子机制，并探索形成这些表型可能的平行进化或趋同进化机制
1.地下鼠的长寿特征 
地下鼠的某些种类的寿命很长，例如普通鼠类寿命一般为1-3年，而盲鼹鼠的寿命可达22年，裸鼹鼠最长寿命可达31年，是普通鼠类寿命的10倍以上。地下鼠的长寿机制尚不清楚，推测可能与黑暗环境中的生物钟调控变异有关。</p>

<p>2.地下鼠黑暗环境中的昼夜节律
生物钟一般严格受外部光信号调节，表现出显着的24小时节律性。然而，生活在地下黑暗洞道中的地下鼠受光周期的影响小，褪黑激素参与程度低，进化了出内源性的24小时昼夜活动节律。探索地下鼠在黑暗的洞道内调节自身的昼夜节律，对光周期紊乱的人群以及深海工作人员、太空探索人员有着重要价值。</p>

<p>3.地下鼠低氧适应
地下鼠对低氧的长期适应，使其成为研究低氧适应的理想实验动物。色田鼠对急性和慢性低氧均具有较强的适应能力，分子机制主要包括高效的能量利用、严格的血管生成调控，以及多层面的细胞修复与凋亡调节；能量代谢和细胞增殖/凋亡水平高。</p>

<p>4.地下鼠和抗癌研究
研究发现体外培养的裸鼹鼠成纤维细胞会分泌大量的高分子量透明质酸（High-molecular-mass hyaluronan, HMM-HA），作者们证实这正是裸鼹鼠能够抵抗癌症发生的重要原因。我们拟以其他地下鼠物种为对象，研究地下鼠类抗癌的分子机制。</p>

<p><strong>Mott physics and high-temperature superconductivity.</strong> Questions of interest include: (i), How does the Mott state collapse upon doping and how is this related to the complex phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors? (ii), What is the strange metal phase seen in correlated electron systems? Is this an exotic long-range entangled state? What is the mechanism of dissipation in that state? (iii), Why is the transition temperature in high-temperature superconductors so high? We have worked on iridates, rhodates, and cuprates.</p>

<p><strong>Nanofabricated “Smart Tips”</strong>.

One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB.</p>

<p><strong>Josephson STM.</strong> Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.
We have used atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. The results and their implications are published in Nature.</p>

<p>We also detected and investigated a quite particular YSR state in the same material.</p>

<p><strong>Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.</strong>  <img src="http://localhost:4000/images/respic/STMHead.png" alt="" style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px" />
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.</p>

<p><strong>Strange Metals.</strong> The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. Here, the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature T in large areas of the phase diagram, with a mean free path that diminishes to a fraction of the interatomic distance. T-linear resistivity is often associated with quantum critical points and marginal-Fermi-liquid physics. In strange metals, the mystery seems to go even further: we deal with something that looks like a quantum critical phase over an extended range of the phase diagram instead of cumulating in a point. There exists no consistent theory for strange metals, leading to more adventurous new approaches including the holographic theories that use insights from gravity to explain strange metals (a recent textbook on this was written by our colleagues at Leiden University, Schalm and Zaanen).
We are part of the ‘Strange Metal consortium NL’ that includes the groups of Hussey, Golden, van Heumen, Zaanen, Schalm, Stoof and Vandoren. </p>

<p><strong>Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.</strong>
We have proposed that artificial super-periodicities can lead to improved superconductivity, both because of increased density of states and because of phase space arguments (see image from our SciPost publication below). Perhaps for different reasons, twisted bilayer graphene has been shown to superconduct! We are investigate this material with the groups of Efetov, Baumberger, and van der Molen.</p>
