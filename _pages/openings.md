# Open positions

### Applications for PhD/Master and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](likexin@lzu.edu.cn). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.


### Master/Undergraduate positions
Sometimes, we take master students or undergraduate students if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
